### Summary 
Project: *Stylometry of pre-revolutionary French pamphlets: authorship attribution and verification*  
  
The objectives were twofold: first, to compile a sample corpus and test its features regarding historical language; second, to verify the authorship of specific pre-revolutionary writings.  
We focused on authors associated with *Palais Royale* as important pre-revolutionary figures. We chose fragments from the *Galerie Universelle*, a little-known multi-volume encyclopaedia, which is historically proven to be connected with the *Palais Royal* circles, as our test texts. Our hypothesis was that the compiled corpus can be used to test whether *Galerie Universelle* sections were written by people close to *Palais Royale*.  
Over the four-month fellowship, a text corpus by selected authors was compiled and tested for authors' styles coherence. After achieving s a high level of same-author clustering, we analysed the texts in question using exploratory stylometric methods (hierarchical clustering) and General Imposters for authorship verification; for both `stylo` implementation was used (Eder et al. 2016). The analysis showed that the methods usually applied to fiction (e.g., novels) can be adjusted to non-fictional historical texts, however the problems of genre bias and text reuse should be addressed in further studies.
